# Scripts

These can be used to generate the outputs in `../outputs`.

- `generate_outputs.sh` - makes the files that are used to make the plots of
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

- `measure_performance.sh` - finds the number of iterations and run time as a
    function of the number of grid points used.

- `catsmallest.py` - reads in one of the eigenvalues files and prints the
    smallest 5 values. This was useful in debugging.
